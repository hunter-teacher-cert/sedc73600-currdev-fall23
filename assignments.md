# Asynchronous Work
#### Most asynchronous work will happen over slack.
Asynchronous work is meant to take up the balance of our class time, since our live zoom sessions are only 1:15 long. Most often, asynchronous activities will take place as discussions over slack in the \#async_curdev slack channel. Usually, you will be asked to post and then respond to posts from others. As such, it is important to the whole class that you do not wait until the start of the following class to do your asynchronous work. If possible, take the remaining time at the end of our zoom sessions to at least add your post.

# Session 00: 08/31
## Assignment:
* filename: **00_standards.md**
  * Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.
  * You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.

## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel, continued from class:
* As a group, create a slack post that summarizes your group's discussion on the points you were discussing:
  * Do you think this concept is a major part of computer science?
  * How well do the individual standards support the concept?
  * How well do the standards seem to conform to given grade levels?
  * Are there areas of this concept that are missing?
* Individually: Look over the different concept/sub-concept threads. Pick 3 (of the ones you didnâ€™t discuss in class), read the related material for those three, and provide your response to the prompts.
