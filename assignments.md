# Asynchronous Work
#### Most asynchronous work will happen over slack.
Asynchronous work is meant to take up the balance of our class time, since our live zoom sessions are only 1:15 long. Most often, asynchronous activities will take place as discussions over slack in the \#async_curdev slack channel. Usually, you will be asked to post and then respond to posts from others. As such, it is important to the whole class that you do not wait until the start of the following class to do your asynchronous work. If possible, take the remaining time at the end of our zoom sessions to at least add your post.

## Session 05: 9/28
# Assignment
  * filename: **05_assignments.md**
  * Develop two assignments that are different types for your unit plan.
  * Describe the assignment, including student facing instructions in a markdown file.

## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
- Make a post about the Python List assignment you developed in class. Be sure to include:
  - A description of the assignment.
  - The intention behind it (what do you want students to get out of it).
- Provide feedback for the three other assignments posted.

## Session 04: 9/28
## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
  Make a post talking about 1 particular style of assignment that you could use in the CS classroom. In the post, describe the style of assignment,  and what exactly its purpose is. Provide a concrete example as well.
  Reply to 2 other posts with examples for that type of assignment.
when I refer to style of assignment, Iâ€™m talking about things like homework, presentation, lab, etc. As opposed to specific examples of those things (which is the second part).

# Session 03: 09/21
## Assignment
* title: **03_language.md**
  - You have been working on an idea for a new course. Select the language that you will use in this course.
  - Explain why your chosen language is the best option for your course. Include an evaluation of how the strengths of the language play to the core concepts of your course.
  - Also explain what weaknesses your chosen language may have. How would you mitigate them?
  - Include what programming environment you will be using.

## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
  1. Make a post about the language you presented in class. Include your answers to the guiding questions I had provided. Before making your post, try to write a program in the language, one or two steps above "hello world" (but it need not be too overboard). If your evaluation changed after programming, explain why.
  2. Pick 2 of the 3 other languages, read the post about them, then try to write a program in each. Reply to the post with additional comments you have about the language not covered by the original post.

# Session 02: 09/14
## Assignment
* title: **02_sequence.md**
  - In the past few assignments, you have been looking into creating a new course.
  - Come up with the big units of the class, and provide a sequence for them.
  - After listing the units in order, provide a narrative describing _why_ you've ordered them that way. Things to consider:
    - Necessary prior knowledge.
    - Natural segues.
    - Natural places to shift gears.
    - etc.

## Asynchronous:
Use your asynchronous time this week to get some fieldwork done.

# Session 01: 09/07
## Assignment:
* filename: **01_compare.md**
* Compare two of the APCSP curricula that were provided (links bellow).
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similarities
  * Comparative strengths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic particularly better/worse over the other, etc.).

## Asynchronous:
* Last week, you came up with an idea for a class you'd like to create. This week, see if you can find at least one example of an existing curriculum for that class.
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel make a post with:
  - Your find curriculum (remind us of the course).
  - Your initial thoughts about it.
  - How you found it (just google search? did you look for a specific source, etc.)

# Session 01: 08/31
## Assignment:
* filename: **00_standards.md**
* Imagine that you can create any Computer Science class you want. What would it be? For this assignment:
  * Provide a high level description of the course.
    * Include main topic(s) and grade level.
  * Explain the motivation behind wanting to create the course.
  * List the NY State standards you believe you would cover in this course. [standards link](https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-k-12.pdf)

================================================================================
## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
* Give a brief description of the course you want to develop as described in your assignment for this week.
  * Provide 3 standards that you would like to address in the class (provide relevant explanatory text for these standards), but you are unsure of how they might fit in.
* After others have posted, reply to each with a suggestion about how they could include one of the standards they mention.
