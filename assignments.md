# Asynchronous Work
#### Most asynchronous work will happen over slack.
Asynchronous work is meant to take up the balance of our class time, since our live zoom sessions are only 1:15 long. Most often, asynchronous activities will take place as discussions over slack in the \#async_curdev slack channel. Usually, you will be asked to post and then respond to posts from others. As such, it is important to the whole class that you do not wait until the start of the following class to do your asynchronous work. If possible, take the remaining time at the end of our zoom sessions to at least add your post.

# Session 01: 09/07
## Assignment:
* filename: **01_compare.md**
* Compare two of the APCSP curricula that were provided (links bellow).
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).

## Asynchronous:
* Last week, you came up with an idea for a class you'd like to create. This week, see if you can find at least one example of an existing curriculum for that class.
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel make a post with:
  - Your find curriculum (remind us of the course).
  - Your initial thoughts about it.
  - How you found it (just google search? did you look for a specific source, etc.)

# Session 00: 08/31
## Assignment:
* filename: **00_standards.md**
* Imagine that you can create any Computer Science class you want. What would it be? For this assignment:
  * Provide a high level description of the course.
    * Include main topic(s) and grade level.
  * Explain the motivation behind wanting to create the course.
  * List the NY State standards you believe you would cover in this course. [standards link](https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-k-12.pdf)

## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
* Give a brief description of the course you want to develop as described in your assignment for this week.
  * Provide 3 standards that you would like to address in the class (provide relevant explanatory text for these standards), but you are unsure of how they might fit in.
* After others have posted, reply to each with a suggestion about how they could include one of the standards they mention.
