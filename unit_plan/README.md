# Unit Plan Formatting
This is a guide for what your unit plan directory should look like

* Fill out the [unit plan template](unit_plan_template.md)
  * Rename this file to README.md
  * This should still be a markdown file
* lessons/
  - Folder containing a separate file for each lesson.
  - These files can be in a format of your choice, please do not include links to google docs, if it started out as a google doc, save it as some stand alone format and place it here.
  - Each lesson should be named __##\_TOPIC__ i.e. __00\_intro__
  - I will not specify a specific format for lessons, but each one should include all lesson components which may include (but not limited to):
    - Main objective
    - Standards
    - In class exercises
    - Notes
    - Handouts
    - Resources
    - Assignments
* code/
  * all source code files should go here
* resources/
  - Folder containing any extra resources being used
* Create a single PDF that contains all the material for your unit it should have, in this order:
  * Unit plan template (README.md)
  * Each lesson
  * Extra resources (if applicable)
