## Course Description:

This Course Will Prepare Candidates To Develop Materials Ranging From
Individual Lessons And Units To Full Courses To Sequences Of Courses
In Alignment With Emerging Local, State, And National Standards To
Educate Students In The Field Of Computer Science.

Attention Will Be Given To Creating Materials Appropriate For A
Diverse Population Of Learners.

Candidates Will Also Be Prepared To Develop Computer Science
Educational Materials That Relate To Other Fields Of Study Thus Giving
All Students A Meaningful Educational Experience Regardless Of Their
Ultimate Career Choice.

Teacher-Candidates Will Produce A Complete Curriculum For A New Class
Designed For A School Which The Candidate Is Familiar.
Teacher-Candidates Will Create A Sample Unit And Individual Lesson
Plan For This Curriculum.

Students Enrolled In This Class Will Also Be Required To Complete 50
Hours Of Fieldwork In New York City Schools Under The Supervision Of A
Hunter College Faculty Member And A Certified New York State Teacher
In Schools Selected By The College.

## Expected Learning Outcomes
**By The End Of This Course, Students Will Be Able To:**

* Design Units, Courses, And Sequences Of Courses In Computer Science Appropriate For A Diverse Population Of Students.
* Design Units, Courses, And Sequences Of Courses Aligned To Emerging Local, State, And Professional Standards In Computer Science Education.
* Employ Current Technologies And Tools To Support The Development And Deployment Of Designed Materials.
* Adapt, Customize, And Implement Existing And New Curricular Materials In Computer Science Education.

## Methods Of Evaluation

* Assignments (Exclusive Of The Unit Plan Project) (25%)
* Developed Curriculum And Class Presentation (55%)
* Class Participation (Including Asynchornous Discussion & Group Work) (20%)
* Field Work: Must Complete 50 Hours To Earn A Passing Grade In This Class
  * Most fieldwork will consist of observing other teachers, being observed by fellow candidates & having post observation discussions.
